iRODS HPSS Resource Plugin
--------------------------

This plugin can be used either as a first class resource or as an archive resource under a compound resource. Please note that bundle and structured file operations will not work in a first class configuration due to those operations making assumptions about an underlying POSIX interface.

To build the HPSS Resource Plugin, you will need to have:

 - the iRODS Development Tools (irods-dev) installed for your platform
     http://irods.org/download

 - the HPSS client from IBM

To use this resource plugin:

  irods@hostname $ iadmin mkresc archiveResc hpss <hostname>:<VaultName> keytab=/var/hpss/etc/irods.keytab;user=irods;mech=[unix,krb]
